can you check this repository and describe in 2-5 sentences what this application is doing  httpsgithub.comIsaevMaksymUC10treemain

I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I currently don't have the ability to browse the internet in real-time or access external databases or websites, including Github. My responses are generated based on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data. I can certainly help explain concepts, write code, debug issues, and more. If you provide more information about the repository or its code, I'd be happy to help explain or clarify to the best of my ability.

        IValidationService _validationService = new ValidationService();

        Console.WriteLine(Please enter your string);
        string userInput = Console.ReadLine();

        Console.WriteLine(Please enter the maximum allowed string length);
        var isNumberValid = Int32.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out int maxLength);

        if (isNumberValid && _validationService.IsValid(userInput, maxLength))
        {
            Console.WriteLine(Your string is valid.);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine(Your inputs are invalid.);
        }

        Console.ReadLine();

This is a simple console application in C# that takes user inputs for a string and a maximum string length. First, the application prompts the user to input a string, and then to input the maximum allowed string length, which must be an integer. The user's inputs are validated using a validation service (_validationService.IsValid). If the maximum string length is a valid integer and the user's string is within the specified length, the console outputs Your string is valid. If not, it outputs Your inputs are invalid.

update description of the previous statement if _validationService.IsValid  is the next code IsValid(string input, int maxLength)
        {
            string pattern = @^(=.[a-z])(=.[A-Z])(=.d)(=.[!#$%&'()+,-.;=@[]^_`{}~])[A-Za-zd!#$%&'()+,-.;=@[]^_`{}~]{1, + maxLength + }$;
            Regex regex = new Regex(pattern);
            return regex.IsMatch(input);
        }
ChatGPT
This application is a console program in C# that validates a user-inputted string based on certain criteria. After asking the user to input a string and a maximum allowed string length (as an integer), it validates this input using the IsValid method from the _validationService. This method checks if the input string meets the following criteria it contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character; and if its length does not exceed the user-specified maximum length. If the string satisfies these conditions, the console outputs Your string is valid; otherwise, it displays Your inputs are invalid.





User
if the user puts string with whitespaces in it will it be valid or invalid
ChatGPT
In the context of the provided IsValid method, a user-inputted string with whitespaces would be considered invalid. The regular expression used for validation (pattern) does not include a whitespace character in its list of valid characters. Therefore, any string containing a whitespace would not match the pattern and the regex.IsMatch(input) method would return false, marking the input as invalid.

describe how to run such program locally
ChatGPT
To run this console application locally, you will need to have .NET Core SDK installed on your machine. Here are the steps

First, create a new folder on your local machine where you want to keep your application.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to this newly created directory.

Now, create a new Console application using the following command dotnet new console. This will create a new console application in the current directory.

Open the newly created Program.cs file in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio.

Replace the auto-generated code in Program.cs with the code for your application.

Once you've saved the changes, go back to the terminalcommand prompt.

Build the application using the command dotnet build. This will compile your application and check for any compilation errors.

If the application builds successfully, run the application using the command dotnet run.

The console will then prompt you to enter your string and the maximum allowed string length.

Remember, every time you make changes to your code, you'll need to build the application again using dotnet build before running it with dotnet run.

Note If you do not have .NET Core SDK installed, you can download it from the official Microsoft .NET website. Just Google .NET Core SDK and follow the instructions provided on the website to install it.

okay. But if I have that downloaded program(solution) and visual studio what my steps should be
ChatGPT
If you have the solution downloaded and you have Visual Studio installed, you can follow these steps to run the program

Open Visual Studio.

Go to File - Open - ProjectSolution or simply press Ctrl + Shift + O.

Navigate to the location where you have the solution file (.sln) downloaded and open it.

After the solution has loaded, you can see your project and all its files in the Solution Explorer. If you don't see the Solution Explorer, go to View - Solution Explorer or press Ctrl + Alt + L.

Open the Program.cs file or whichever file that contains your Main method by double-clicking on it in the Solution Explorer.

Now that you have the program open, you can run it by pressing F5 or by clicking on the green Start Debugging arrow in the toolbar at the top.

A console window will open and you will be prompted to enter a string and the maximum allowed string length, as specified in your program.

Remember, any changes you make to the code will be automatically saved when you start debugging (run the program). But you can also manually save at any time by pressing Ctrl + S or going to File - Save All.

can you describe this Regular expression function IsValid(string input, int maxLength)
        {
            string pattern = @^(=.[a-z])(=.[A-Z])(=.d)(=.[!#$%&'()+,-.;=@[]^_`{}~])[A-Za-zd!#$%&'()+,-.;=@[]^_`{}~]{1, + maxLength + }$;
            Regex regex = new Regex(pattern);
            return regex.IsMatch(input);
        }
ChatGPT
Sure. This function, IsValid(string input, int maxLength), uses a regular expression to validate the input string against a set of criteria. The function takes two parameters the string to be validated and a maximum length for the string.

The regular expression, or pattern, breaks down as follows

^ asserts the start of the line.

(=.[a-z]) is a positive lookahead, checking for at least one lowercase letter from a to z.

(=.[A-Z]) is another positive lookahead, checking for at least one uppercase letter from A to Z.

(=.d) checks for at least one digit.

(=.[!#$%&'()+,-.;=@[]^_{}~])` checks for at least one of the provided special characters.

[A-Za-zd!#$%&'()+,-.;=@[]^_{}~]{1,+maxLength+}$ensures that the entire string only consists of the previously defined characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, special characters) and its length is between 1 and the maximum length defined by the user.$` asserts the end of the line.

The Regex.IsMatch(input) method then tests whether the input string matches this pattern. If it does, the function returns true indicating the input is valid according to the given conditions. If it doesn't, the function returns false, indicating the input string is invalid.
